Q2. Fetch Data

Your task is to create a React component that fetches and displays user information from an API. Specifically, the component should make a GET request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1" and display the fetched user's name, email, and username. The component should initially display a loading placeholder text until the data is fetched successfully.

Functional Requirements
Data Fetching:

Implement an asynchronous operation within the component to fetch user data from the provided URL upon component mounting.
State Management:

Utilize React's useState hook to manage the fetched data state within your component.
Effect Hook:

Use React's useEffect hook to trigger the data fetching operation when the component mounts. Ensure that the fetching operation is performed only once.
Conditional Rendering:

Display a placeholder text (<h2>Loading dataâ€¦</h2>) while the data is being fetched.
Once the data is fetched, display the user's name, email, and username.
If there is an error, show the error like (<h2>Error fetching data</h2>)
